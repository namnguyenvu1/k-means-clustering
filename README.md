This is a notebook where I use clustering to seperate datapoints into 3 subgroups

The data is simple but simply populate the dataset as well as the number of indexes for each datapoint will help to populate the data.

Also I want to learn unsupervised learning there is no pre-assigned groups. The same knowledge could be used for classification of other things
